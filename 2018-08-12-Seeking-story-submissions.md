The Mid Michigan Journal is seeking submissions of articles, event information, and photography from central Michigan area residents. If you have news you would like to have shared with the community, there is a form on the site that you can use to submit it directly, or you can send it via email to editor@midmichiganjournal.com.Fully formed articles are the best, but feel free to share news tips or ideas and I will follow up.I am also looking for volunteer editors/coordinators who are available to help find stories to cover from around the Mount Pleasant area.Feel free to contact me on Facebook or via email at [jon@midmichiganjournal.com](mailto:jon@midmichiganjournal.com) if you have questions or would like to learn more.
