<h2>The Gist</h2>
The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival is currently seeking a volunteer who is interested in serving the role of Parade Chair. This person would be responsible for the promotion, planning, budgeting, and implementation for the parade during the annual Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival, held in April.

Anybody who is interested should contact Pete Alexander, SMSF chairman, at (989) 828-5422 or by email at <a href="mailto:lisaalogan@hotmail.com">lisaalogan@hotmail.com</a>.
<h2>Reaction</h2>
Volunteering for the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival can be a lot of hard work, but it is also fun and rewarding. While it is a big project with a lot of moving parts (meant both literally and figuratively), it is also a key event during the festival.
