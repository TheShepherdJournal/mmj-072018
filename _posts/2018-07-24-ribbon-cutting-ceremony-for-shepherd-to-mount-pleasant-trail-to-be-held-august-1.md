A ribbon cutting ceremony will be held in side the Veterans Memorial Park on Wednesday, August 1 at 5:30 p.m. to commemorate the completion of a non-motorized trail which connects the Village of Shepherd with Mount Pleasant. This section of trail is the latest completed as a part of a network of walking trails which will eventually extend across Gratiot, Clare, and Isabella Counties. The project is being overseen by the Mid Michigan Community Pathways.

The Friends of Mid-Michigan Community Pathways will also be hosting a 5K run/walk along the new trail. The 5K run/walk will start at 6:30 p.m. Registration for this event is $5 per person, but there is no cost to entry for the first 100 registrants.

To RSVP, contact Wendy Oswald at (989) 506-6709 or via email at <a href="mailto:gwendalyn@gmail.com">gwendalyn@gmail.com</a>. You can also contact Steve Davidson at (989) 854-0147 or via email at <a href="mailto:dpwsteve@yahoo.com">dpwsteve@yahoo.com</a>.
