He has more plates, screws, broken bones, and time in the hospital than anyone else I know. He also has more drive, determination, and mind over matter ability than most on this planet. From being in a wheel chair 2 years ago I just witnessed him do a triathlon where he swam 750 meters, biked 20km, and then ran 5km. This just goes to show you that your mind is a powerful thing and if you decide to do something sometimes your mind is the only thing that holds you back. Way to go Jimmy Childs! You are the man!”</li>
