The Shepherd Sports Boosters are pleased to announce our 2nd Annual Bluejay Booster Bash to be held on Saturday, March 16, 2019 at St. Vincent Parish Hall in Shepherd, MI. Advanced ticket sales are encouraged at $75 per person. The ticket covers entry into a reverse raffle, where 15 people will win cash prizes, the highest being the grand prize of $700. Appetizers, two complimentary alcoholic drinks, and a catered buffet dinner with desert is included in the ticket price. The event kicks of at 6pm with appetizers and cocktail hour.

The Shepherd Sports Boosters was created as a means to support our local student athletes, coaches and teams over 20 years ago. It was a very small organization with only 4-5 members. In 2017 a group of people including Jay Travis, our athletic director, decided to grow the Sports Boosters and try to raise a greater amount of funds to help all Shepherd athletic teams even more! We are working towards limiting the amount of fundraisers that each team has to do for uniforms, equipment and team camp opportunities. This also eases the burden on parents, local businesses and community members being asked all year long to support our athletes. The Sports Boosters have always supported Shepherd sports teams as they made appearances at State Finals and several other athletic adventures including uniform and equipment purchases<i> </i>and will continue to do so with funds raised from the Booster Bash.

The Bluejay Booster Bash was created as our once a year, large scale fundraiser, that we hope will raise enough funds for all of our teams. At our first annual Bash in 2018 we were able to solely fund an Athletic Trainer for the benefit of all of our athletes! This is an endeavor that we would like to keep moving forward. A portion from all ticket sales directly impacts the retaining of an Athletic Trainer for the 2019-2020 school year.

During our 2nd Annual Bluejay Booster Bash we will offer a few games for a chance to win some excellent prizes including an “ultimate tailgater” package, Apple Watch and Cabela’s cooler stuffed with beverages. We will have a silent and live auction with items varying from a “new driver car care kit” to a kayak; an “ultimate outdoorsmen” hunting basket to a Smart TV and a chance to bid on suite tickets to a 2019 CMU Football game. The suite includes all appetizers and beverages for four. There will be something for everyone! We have many generous local sponsors to thank, without them this event would not be possible. All sponsors will be recognized leading up to the event and the night of the Bash on our Facebook page, “Shepherd Sports Boosters.”
