Shepherd community members will be coming together once again to help carve pumpkins as a part of the Roth Pumpkinfest 2018 taking place at 109 North Second Street. A total of 1,500 pumpkins will be gutted and craved by volunteers.

The schedule will be as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Saturday, October 28, volunteers are needed who are available to help gut the pumpkins.</li>
 	<li>Sunday, October 29, volunteers will be working together to carve the pumpkins starting at noon.</li>
</ul>
Portable heaters and tents will be set up to help keep volunteers warm while they are carving pumpkins. When completed, the pumpkins will be kept on display and lit until Halloween night.
