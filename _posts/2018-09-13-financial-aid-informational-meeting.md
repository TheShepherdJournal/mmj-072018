<h2>The Gist</h2>
The Shepherd High School will be hosting a Financial Aid Night on Thursday, October 25th at 6 p.m. inside the Media Center.

The following organizations will be represented and giving presentation on scholarships:
<ul>
 	<li>Mt. Pleasant Community Foundation</li>
 	<li>Mid Michigan Community College</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reaction</h2>
As a father of a recent high school graduate, I can not stress how incredibly important it is to attend this informational meeting and get a head start on planning out what scholarships your senior could be applying for as they begin thinking about their college plans.
