"When asked what is something that the guests want the general people to know, a guest said ‘please remember that we are people. We are not criminals. You don’t have to be scared of us.’ What a great statement! Honestly, many of us are just an illness or lost job away from being in this exact situation."

<h1>Thankfulness</h1>
<h2>Coffee</h2>
<img title="" src="http://midmichiganjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/null.png" alt="" width="364" height="364" />

Dear Coffee,

I wanted to take a minute to tell you why I appreciate you and your admirable qualities.

I’m thankful for your existence. The way you make a room smell. Sometimes strong and bitter, but on the other hand you can also make it smell sweet and savory. When walking into a shop where you’re living, your scent can really wake a person up. It’s an overpowering bold smell. Your scent can fill an entire football field sized room. Your smell fills up a room as fast a snap, faster than you can say the word coffee.

Your taste is another admirable quality you portray. You’re so yummy sometimes when you’re warm I can feel you fill my belly up. You’re a variety of many types. You have different flavored beans that can brew and coffee flavors to accent your entirety, ranging from vanilla or cinnamon to hazelnut or pumpkin spice.  I like the many flavors you have. It’s not just your flavor that I enjoy but also the temperature. You come hot and steamy which really fills me up and makes me happy on a cold day. You also can come cold which is satisfying to enjoy because there’s whip cream and froth on top. Delicious.

I appreciate the way you make me feel. You make me energized. It could be a 3am think session or an all nighter with friends and you’re the reason I can stay awake. On the other hand though, you help me focus. I can concentrate way easier with you in my system. You keep me awake and alert. A good part is you’re all around you don’t resign in one location. You’re such a tasty beverage I appreciate your existence to the max.

Sincerely,

Summer Wheelington

Dear the game of football,

I am writing this letter to thank you for keeping me active. Because you have to run a lot in football. Also you really don’t stop moving in the game. Last if you don’t have the ball you can do something to help the person who was the ball.

I am also thankful to football for giving me something to do with friends. Like when my friends come over i like to play football with them. Also i like to watch football with my friends and family. Last i like to talk about it with friends.

Last thing i am thankful for being able to watch football. When i am bored i watch football on youtube. Also i like to watch it with my dad. Last i like to watch my favorite team play.

<h2>House</h2>
<img title="" src="http://midmichiganjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/null.png" alt="" width="364" height="364" />

Dear House,

I was just going to write you a letter to tell you how thankful I am for you, because you do a lot for me and my family.

I am thankful that you have a roof so that we do not get snowed or rained on. You make sure that the rain doesn’t leak through our roof, and fall onto the floors and ruin things. I am thankful that you have a heater and air conditioning, so that we don’t freeze in the winter, or over heat in the summer. Another thing that I am thankful for, is that you have rooms for everyone in my house, so that I don’t have to share a room with one of my annoying siblings. I am thankful that you have a kitchen for me to make and eat lots of food in, because without food, I’d be dead. I’m thankful that you have doors with locks on them, so that no one can just come in our house without permission. All of the things that you do for us House, is truly amazing.

Some more things that I am thankful for about you House, is how beautiful you look. You are the direct opposite of ugly. You have so much character on the inside and out, plus you are the perfect shade of bluish-gray. The color combinations of each room is just amazing. And to mention the combinations of furniture and decorations inside of your rooms, are just incredible. Each room is like a different world. You have so many amazing characteristics that we all appreciate.

Wait. I know I am super thankful for you, but you are missing a few things. For example, like my room has no closet doors. By having some closet doors will make my room look even better than it does already. Another thing that I need from you, is some stair railings. Right now it’s a hazardous area without the railings, because I like almost fall every day! It’s okay though, they just might be a nice addition. Even without these things, I am still so incredibly thankful for all that you do for me, and my family.

Sincerely,

Mea Coffman
<h2>Nellie</h2>
<img title="" src="http://midmichiganjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/null.png" alt="" width="364" height="364" />

Dear Nellie,

I am tremendously thankful for all the things you’ve done for me. You make me laugh a lot. Every day you put a smile on my face. You are just so funny especially when you yell at us in that croaky voice it is just so funny. Another thing you do for me is help me when needed. So like when I am working on something like cleaning or making something you will ask me if I want help. Usually you only ask me if I want help if you think what I am doing is fun but you know it works.  When I am sick you will always be there to make me feel better. You listen to me complain like I can complain about the stupidest stuff and you will just sit there and pretend to care. The fact that to sit there and listen shows to me you care. Even though you say smart remarks at the end of me complaining it is just so funny I always end up laughing and I then feel better. You grew up with me and we both went through the struggles of our mom abandoning us and there is no way I could have went through it without you.

I can literally always count on you. You will always stick up for me, so when you are at school and somebody is talking bad about me I know you won’t let them. Or when one of the siblings will try to lie about me you will always make sure mom gets the truth. When I get in trouble you will say you are a part of it when really you were not. You only said that so I would not get in as much trouble. You think you always have to be with me and it just makes me feel so comforted. When you go to to the store or youth group you need me to go or else you would not go. You will pretty much go everywhere I go. You always think of me no matter what or where you are. When you get something you make sure I get it too. I just know that I can trust you no matter what and that I can tell you anything trusting you not to tell anyone what I told you. I just absolutely love you Nellie. You mean the world to me and I really do not know what I would do without you.

Sincerely,

Wasson

<h2>God</h2>
<img title="" src="http://midmichiganjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/null.png" alt="" width="364" height="364" />

Dear God,

I am thankful for you . I am thankful for you because you took away my sin by brutally dying on that cross for me. You died on that cross for me you did it for me and to take away my sin. You had every chance, and every right to walk away and not, but no, thank you dying for me and taking away my sin.

I am thankful for the gift and the chance of everlasting life that you give me. Thank you for the free gift of everlasting life you gave us the biggest birthday/surprise/everything to look up to. You give us a choice and a wonder of what we would see in this world of everlasting life in heaven with you. Thank you for allowing me to be the one to bring people to your kingdom in heaven and give them the chance of everlasting life.

I am also thankful for the fact that you have given me a church body and a Christian body to look up to and ask questions to. I thank you for allowing me to be one of those that are actually able to go to church, and to be able to have a very good background in church and out of church.

God I am thankful for you because I love you and everything that you do for me and I love that you give me everything. I also love that all you ask in return is for us to love and follow you.

Love,

Brennan Bass
<h2>Brooke</h2>
<img title="" src="http://midmichiganjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/null.png" alt="" width="364" height="364" />

Dear Brooke,

I wanted to write to you to thank you. You’re so loving and talking to you helps me a lot more than you know. Hopefully this letter can improve your day.

I first wanted to thank you for being kind to me. You reassure me when I’m upset by telling me that everything will be okay. You talk me through difficult things I’m experiencing. You are a person I feel I can rant to without fear of judgement. You’ve never made fun of me for something weird I’ve said or done and that has meant so much to me.

Thank you for caring about me, you always stand up for me when I need it. You ask how I’m doing when I seem off and you try to help when possible. If I’m not feeling great you accept that and understand that sometimes that happens and I don’t need to feel good all the time.

Finally, I’d like to thank you for being so generous. You’ve given me gifts just because you wanted to make me smile. You put my feelings before yours when we talk and I always feel appreciated when I’m around you.

Love,

Ella

Dear Books,

I just wanted you to know how thankful I am for you. You are so entertaining. You are always there for me and you can be used almost anywhere. I just think that you don’t get enough attention, now that I think about it.

I am thankful for how entertaining you are. You have different genres and styles, so I can never be bored.  Everyone of you are entertaining in your own way. What I mean by that is you all are entertaining. Everyone of you is unique in your own way, because even if I read the same book more than once, I would find something new every time.

I am thankful for how you are always there for me.  You are small enough to fit in a bag, yet big enough so I don’t get bored . You never change, so I can always count on you to be there.

You are able to be read almost anywhere. I am able to read you on long or short car rides. I am able to read you at home . And I am able to read you while waiting for something( like a doctors appointment.)

Sincerely

Aydn Schwartz
<h2>Summer</h2>
<img title="" src="http://midmichiganjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/null.png" alt="" width="364" height="364" />

Dear Summer,

I wanted to write you this letter to tell you how thankful I am for you, you have been a blessing in my life. You have given  me so many things to be thankful for you, and I wanted to tell you some of those things.

I am thankful for the beautiful warm weather and the morning breeze you bring to me.  The rays of sunshine that brighten my days, that bring tranquillity to my soul. For the warm morning breeze that I listen to, that calls out to me.  Spending hours on my trampoline just listening to the breeze as it yells, just to be heard. Your overcast days are my favorite because I get lost in my thoughts, trying to decipher my future in the clouds.

I am also thankful for the things I am able to do with you.  With such long hours in the day when I am swimming late in the evenings,  you can see the sun and the moon appear together in the same horizon. When I go camping with you, I get lost in the woods of your beauty.  I listen to all the things you have to say, through the small crickets and the roaring waves of Lake Michigan. I run along, feeling the sand beneath my toes on the shore, as each stride I  make spreads a feeling of freedom. Finding Petoskey stones and sea glass as I hear the boats come in and the waves go out, as the sun is saying goodnight, goodnight.

Finally, one last thing I want to tell you why I am thankful for you is, you give me independence.  You let me be who I am, go along with my crazy adventures, and just let me breathe. You are the one that lets me forget that I do not have to follow a schedule or a time; you let me go on my own time.  With you I can sleep past when the rooster crows and let the rest of the world keep going while I am still dozing off. I can walk by myself and not have the whole world on top of my shoulders. I can give all my worries to you and let them fade away through the night  sky. I can swing in my hammock and close my eyes and fall asleep to the sound of the tree’s talking amongst themselves. Thank you Summer for being here when I need you most, so I could escape the uneasiness of this world.

I hope when you read this letter, you might get  a better understanding on how blessed I am to have you in my life. I thank you again for everything, and I hope to see you soon!

Yours truly,

Ana McGuire
<h2>Crystella Winkelman (my mom)</h2>
Dear Mom,

I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you. You are such a great person and you need to know that.

I am thankful that you give me a sense of independence. You let me make my own decision most of the time. This allows me to play on the XBox whenever I ask. You give me a sense of independence that is almost 100% when it comes to the use of the XBox. It also flows into the use of my phone. You let me use the my phone whenever and I can text all my friends. I am so glad that you let me use the technology in our house with independence.

I am also thankful for your guidance. You always give it to me at just the right time. You are always there to give it to me when I need it. Along with perfect timing, you also give it to me from the best source, the Bible. You always turn to God’s Word the Bible and it always helps me. When you find out about my situation you go straight to the Bible without criticizing me at all. You never criticize me and are very compassionate. You show no signs of criticism whatsoever, no facial expressions or anything. I am so glad that you give me guidance.

I am also glad that you listen to me. When I talk to you, you are completely focused on me. You do not get distracted by anything. You are able to do that because you pay attention to me, too. You truly listen to me and I know this because you can help me. You are 100% there and are captivated by what I am saying. You really listen to me and pay complete attention to me. I am so glad that you truly listen to me.I hope you read this letter knowing that you are loved. I also hope that you see this and you feel motivated to continue your hard work.

All love,

Your son,

Levi
<h2>Fiction</h2>
Dear Fiction

I want to take a moment of your time to say how thankful i am of you. I always try to be around you but i have been lacking due to school work and my own lack of ambition to pursue new avenues of yourself.

Fiction has helped me learn about different emotions. Fiction has always been full of life and willing to help me learn to show emotions. It helps me recognize the emotions my friends are going through and how i can help them. It help me to remain calm and helps me mask my emotions. The emotions in it has taught me to love the emotions it brings out in people.

Fiction has taught me many lessons over the years. Fiction has taught me to not believe in myself, instead i should believe in the people that believe in me. Fiction has taught me to smile when i’m sad and to laugh when im hurt. Fiction has taught me these lessons and many more by showing me why i should and showing me examples. Fiction has taught me many lessons over the years that I have really helped me and continue to help to this day.

Fiction is something I love for it’s depth for many reasons. I have a love for the depth of fiction because it can have many symbolic meanings. Fiction can also show the depth of a characters emotions. I love it when fiction shows the depth of sorrow that a character can go through. Lastly, I love the dynamics of character interaction within your fiction.

I hope you’ve read my letter with an understanding that you are loved and needed a whole lot. Feel free to make more of your wondrous fiction and know that with every hater there’s is a million more that love you.

Sincerely,

Landen Lake
<h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
Dear Thanksgiving,

I wrote this letter because I’m thankful for you.

I am thankful for the food our family cooks on your day. I am thankful for the turkey that we hunt and eat for your day. I am thankful for the turkey smelling and tasting delicious. I am thankful for the traditional cranberry sauce my grandma makes.

I am thankful for spending time with my two families on your day and having fun. I am thankful for me and my siblings getting along. I am thankful for the games we play together as a family. I am thankful for getting along with my parents.

I am thankful that you are a holiday!

Sincerely,

Anastasia Gross
<h2>My Family</h2>
Dear Family,

I wanted to say that I am very thankful for you guys. You guys make me super happy and everyday it is for different reasons. Here is a letter about why I am thankful for you all.

One of you I am thankful for is dad. Dad, you are always there for me no matter what the situation is. If I have any problems with boys, or school you are there to fight it with me. When I had surgery it was very hard for me to move or to get into vehicles, but you were there to help me. Something I am very glad I get to do with you is shoot guns. You were there to teach me how to shoot a gun. Not only for fun but to protect myself and you guys as well.

Another one of you I am thankful for is mom. One thing I am thankful for is when i’m sick, you are there. Also when I had my surgery you were right by my side before I went in and when I got out. I love that about you Mom. You make me happy and laugh all the time. Some things you say just cracks me up. When we are together we have a very good time. You can bake also and I like that because I love your cookies and bread.

Besides mom and dad I am also thankful for you Hunter. You are always there to drive me places. Anywhere I need to go you are there to take me. An example is like the other day I went to visit a friend in the hospital, and even though you are scared to go into hospitals because of what happened to our aunt you still took me and sat there with me. If I want to go shopping, you take me. We have a very good relationship. We hardly ever fight and when we do it does not last long. We always listen to music together and laugh about how each other is singing or dancing.

If I were to lose any of you, I would be devastated. You guys are everything to me and i’m glad I have you all in my life.

Sincerely,

Ashley Fairchild
<h2>Marvel</h2>
Dear Marvel,

I wanted to snag this time to thank you for your  ability to entertain me and my brothers. I’ve noticed that most of the movies that we watch are your movies and we always seem to go back to them at one time or another. I love them so much, I could watch them over and over forever.

I love how you take people who don’t have anything and are invisible to everyone else, and make them heros that help others. In the Captain America trilogy you took Steve Rogers, a skinny man who wants to be a soldier, and transform him to a superhuman. Steve Rogers is amazing because he is the last person that I would choose to be a hero and yet he is the best person to be Captain America. Spiderman, also known as Peter Parker, is kinda the same. He isn’t really given the second glance and he feels like he isn’t able to impress or help others because he doesn’t have the skill or ability. After the bite, he was granted  powers and abilities that he used to help others.Now he uses them to assist others and stop what happened to his uncle from happening to other people. Spiderman and Captain America are two amazing examples on how Marvel is able to take different characters and create awesome plots and backstories for them.

I also love how you take the characters and create a background story that does a great job of explaining how something,or someone, came to become what they are.  For example, Peter Parker was a high-level student who lived with his aunt and uncle because of his parents died.He was the one you chose to carry the mantle of Spiderman. Peter, after getting bitten, he used the powers as a waste and in the act of getting money.e lost his uncle to the man he could’ve stopped.  Peter was able to have Tony Stark, Iron Man, mentor him and help him with his abilities. Captain America was kinda similar with the fact that his parents died. The difference is that he wanted to protect his country , but he’s too weak and small to fight. Then they gave him the serum and now he’s able to help others and fight for the freedom of the people. His friends, Buck Barnes and Falcon, make sure he’s never alone. Spinning off of that, you do a fantastic job when you bring them all together.

Last but not least, I wanna thank you for having the creativity to be able to bring together all the heroes together in some way. You, Marvel, are really good at bringing heroes, and villains, from the ends of the galaxies together when needed. One example is that in the movie Captain America Civil War.There is a debate and the heroes have to choose sides.Tony picked Peter Parker. Peter lives in Queens and yet Tony was able to get him even though they were in different parts of the New York. I also enjoy that even though some of the heroes don’t like each other, they still come to help one another love how you do that. I’m astonished how you are able to bring them together without having it be confusing. When Thanos comes to attack the earth, Tony Stark, despite his previous fight, decided to call Steve……who answered the call! They were able to unite the Guardians of the Galaxy, The Avengers, and Wakanda to help try to defeat the titan lord. So Marvel, I really enjoy how you keep your audience really captured when you produce the movies, the books, and the characters. I really couldn’t think of life without you.

I really hope that you keep up the good work and create many more plots, characters, and villains so I can look up to them.

With great appreciation
