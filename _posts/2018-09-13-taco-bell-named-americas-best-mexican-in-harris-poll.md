<h2>The Gist</h2>
It seems that people really are willing to make a "run for the border." Taco Bell has been named "America's best Mexican restaurant" based on the results of a recent Harris Poll. This is according to a post <a href="https://abc7.com/food/taco-bell-voted-as-the-best-mexican-restaurant-of-2018/4225555/">here</a>. Taco Bell is now the fourth largest fast-food chain just behind McDonald's, Starbucks, and Subway.<!--more-->
<h2>Reaction</h2>
I am not a huge fan of Taco Bell, so I find this to be a bit shocking. Something that is also shocking to me is that Wendy's and Burger King are no longer considered to be among the top four fast food restaurants!

It seems more likely that Taco Bell would have been the most recognizable Mexican restaurant on a list. Last year, Moe's held the title, and Chipotle was America's Best Mexican restaurant in 2016.
