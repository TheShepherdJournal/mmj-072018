<h2>The Gist</h2>
The Shepherd Chamber of Commerce has announced that their annual Holly Jolly Christmas Parade will take place on Thursday, November 29, 2018.

They are also accepting applications from organizations which would like to enter a float into the parade. The deadline for applications is November 22, 2018.

<h2>Reaction</h2>
In past years, this event has been chock full of holiday goodies including decorations around the Village of Shepherd, a live choir, and of course the arrival of Santa Claus at the end of the parade. Later, kids will visit with Santa inside the Santa Claus house.

Stay tuned as we learn new details.
