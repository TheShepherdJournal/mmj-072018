<blockquote><span id="u_ps_0_0_3">Congratulations</span> to Shepherd Girl’s Golf for capturing the FIRST PLACE Trophy at the Chippewa Hills Team Scramble at The Royal Golf Course in Canadian Lakes!

In addition: 1st Place Medalists were Olivia Raymond and Morgan Yates. 2nd Place Medalists were Maggie Bryant and Angie Yuncker!

Freshman Mackenzie Showalter and Jenna Gates had a great experience!

A coach couldn’t be any prouder of their solid performance and great team camaraderie!</blockquote>
