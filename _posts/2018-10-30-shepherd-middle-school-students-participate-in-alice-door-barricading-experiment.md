<p>Three students from Mr. Nestle's 7th grade science class experimented with different ways they could barricade a door using a table and chairs. The exercise was a part of the ALICE program which is being implemented in the school districts.</p>
<p>&quot;The students did AWESOME and had zero prior instruction as we wanted to 'let them figure it out,' the Shepherd Police Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/205632619455314/photos/a.211341935551049/2159154567436433/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBYEjO4_3n829JcACnCg1iKkYK5lL3A9CA4cXqqxkWkQ_lys8ocjTvIxoi4ci22mScQpZ8jziC2yOtI0y52aAA28n4F9LRV6okWe3FWrteUEf5xpc0eRX6srY-7PcWac-I4_YiIzgXf_TVPAAEvytKMNmK9cIHdpKuQG8AGJqK6z_BhX9OSkKucXbbTNuetp43RlYOMvjZQ4lLHM93JH2ou4yo&amp;__tn__=-R">Facebook page</a> states. &quot;Unfortunately it is a reality that we have to prepare our students for this, but hope and pray they never, ever have to use it..&quot;</p>
<p>After the exercise, Chief Sawyer discussed the ALICE technique with the students.</p>
