<h2>“The Queen of Soul”</h2>
Thursday Morning at around 9:50 a.m. Arethea Franklin passed away at 76 years old at her home in Detroit, surrounded by Friends and Family. A statement by the family said that Franklin's Oncologist confirmed The "Official cause of death was due to Advance Pancreatic Cancer of the Neuroendocrine Type". This comes just days after sources say she was in hospice care at her home.

"In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart. We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and cousins knew no bounds," The Singer's family said.

Her gospel-rooted singing is what got her the title "The Queen of Soul". Originally her Father Clarence LaVaughn Franklin wanted to give her Piano lessons but she declined and began gospel singing back when she was 14 years old. In 1960 she signed with Columbia Records as an All-purpose Entertainer, then later signed with Atlantic Records as a Soul and R&amp;B singer. Franklin had been battling health issues in the recent years. She had to cancel Numerous Performances from 2010 to 2013. She underwent surgery which was "Highly Successful" according to Surgeons And in 2014, she recovered enough to go on tour, again. She'd lost a considerable amount of weight and even purchased new wardrobe.

Franklin told USA Today "It's fun buying new clothes!" She also said she planned to give her old Wardrobe to a Resale shop. "I couldn't stay out of the mirror, just turning every way. This is my natural weight." she said. Funeral Arrangements have not yet been announced.
