<p>It is the beginning of October, and there are already hints of the changing colors on the trees in the Village of Shepherd. Still a lot of green, but this only makes the trees with orange or red colored leaves stand out more.</p>
<p>Enjoying the changing colors? Share photos of trees with changing colors, or other fall themed scenes, via our <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/potd">Picture of the Day form</a>. Or, you can email photos to <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.</p>
