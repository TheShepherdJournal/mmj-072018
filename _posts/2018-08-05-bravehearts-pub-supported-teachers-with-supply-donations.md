I caught up with Charles Chapman, owner of the Bravehearts Pub in Alma, after I saw his post stating that he was donating 12 boxes of school supplies to any teachers who stopped by his business. I asked him over Facebook messenger for details why he was doing this.

"I've always been a firm believer in giving back to the community," Chapman said.Â  "We've had a very good summer at the bar so I thought it would be a good time to give something back." Chapman said that another way that the bar gives back to the community is by giving away free Christmas trees during the holiday season.

Three days after making the announcement, all of the boxes had been passed out.

"All of the boxes are gone," a follow up post on Bravehearts Pub reads. "Good luck on the new year. Glad we could help out a little."

Emily Lint, a teacher from Chippewa Hills, was one of the teachers who picked up a box of supplies. "This is a great way to kick off my first year of teaching."
