<p>I caught up with Charles Chapman, owner of the Bravehearts Pub in Alma, after I saw his post stating that he was donating 12 boxes of school supplies to any teachers who stopped by his business. I asked him over Facebook messenger for details why he was doing this.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always been a firm believer in giving back to the community,&quot; Chapman said.Â  &quot;We've had a very good summer at the bar so I thought it would be a good time to give something back.&quot; Chapman said that another way that the bar gives back to the community is by giving away free Christmas trees during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Three days after making the announcement, all of the boxes had been passed out.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the boxes are gone,&quot; a follow up post on Bravehearts Pub reads. &quot;Good luck on the new year. Glad we could help out a little.&quot;</p>
<p>Emily Lint, a teacher from Chippewa Hills, was one of the teachers who picked up a box of supplies. &quot;This is a great way to kick off my first year of teaching.&quot;</p>
