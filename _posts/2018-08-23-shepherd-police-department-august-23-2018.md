<h4>Old US 27 Motor Tour</h4>
<b>Craig Parrish</b>

Good Morning Shepherd

I am the Director of the Michigan Old US 27 Motor Tour, in its 12th year, Thursday we will just be passing through Downtown Shepherd heading up N. Shepherd road to Baseline Rd, then left to Old 27, through Rosebush then Clare with cars and people from Michigan,4 states, and Canada, we won’t be long, we love to come through your community, people out in their yards, waving, signs, welcoming us, thanks to the Shepherd Police Dept and County Sheriffs for all their help and escorts...

<h4>Speed Traps</h4>
<b>Deborah Bailey</b>

I was told that if a police officer is parked (in a parking lot etc...) without some sort of lights on that it’s consider entrapment, and they’re not allowed to do that. I say “if you’re not following the law then it doesn’t matter.

<b>Shepherd Police Department</b>

Guess I'll need more details...kinda of confused. Are you speaking about a police officer sitting in a parking lot running radar on cars on the road?

<b>Deborah Bailey</b>

Yes, sorry I wasn’t clear on that. Lol

<b>Shepherd Police Department</b>

A police officer can 100% do that.

<b>Deborah Bailey</b>

Thank you. It feels good though be right. Lol
<h4>Tailgating</h4>
<b>Laurie Kamrowski</b>

What are you supposed to do when you are being tailgated even when you are doing the speed limit?

<b>Shepherd Police Department</b>

Keep driving the speed limit and if you feel the need pull over. Do not "brake check" the car...because they'll probably slam into you. Will they we at fault...most likely...did your vehicle just get ruined and you run the chance of getting injured...definitely.
