<p>Last week, one hundred and fifty guests gathered in front of the Shepherd Post Office to enjoy a meal made from locally grown ingredients and prepared by local chefs. It was all a part of a fundraiser for the St. Vincent De Paul Food Pantry in Shepherd called Farm to Table.</p>
<h4>The Gist</h4>
<p>The evening started with a silent auction, during which attendees made bids on different items. Then, appetizers were served, and then it was time for the main course. Attendees were also entertained by live music performed by Tinker's Folly.
