Later this month, I will be merging the <i>Shepherd Journal</i> Facebook page with the page for the <i>Mid Michigan Journal</i>. This is a change that was inevitable when I decided to go a little larger with a website that covered the central Michigan area.

The <i>Shepherd Journal’s </i>mission will continue to live on in the <i>Mid Michigan Journal’s </i>website, where I will continue to report on events and news from the Shepherd community. It will also continue in the group that I’ve started, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/shepherdlive/">Shepherd Live News</a>. I think that these changes will offer followers more opportunities for engagement and collaboration.

I would not have gotten this far with the <i>TSJ</i> without the support and encouragement of residents, page followers, and page moderators. It started out as a half-baked social media experiment, then evolved into a news resource. It’s this support which motivated me to start a news website of my own.

Before I launched the <i>Mid Michigan Journal</i>, I thought a long time about whether I wanted to stay focussed on Shepherd, or expand out. Eventually, I realized that a regional news site would overcome a limitation I had encountered with the ultra local approach. Shepherd residents are affected by the things that happen outside of the community of Shepherd. Also, people outside of Shepherd like to learn about things that are happening inside Shepherd. Ultimately, a regional news website serves more people.

I wanted to thank everybody who has supported me with my local new venture over the last few years. And, I wanted to invite you to join me on this latest news project. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.

Thanks,
