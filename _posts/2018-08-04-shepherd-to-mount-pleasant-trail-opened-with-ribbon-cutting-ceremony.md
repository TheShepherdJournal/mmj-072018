<p>A ribbon cutting ceremony was held Wednesday, August 1 to recognize the opening of the trail that connects the Village of Shepherd with Mount Pleasant. The project, completed this summer, is the latest to be undertaken by the Mid Michigan Community Pathways organization.</p>
<p>The organization’s goal is to construct a network of trails which stretch from Ithaca to Clare.</p>
<p>During his opening statement, Mid Michigan Community Pathways president Steve Davidson thanked the numerous organizations and individuals who had contributed to the construction of the Shepherd to Mount Pleasant pathway. He also said that a major goal of the trail was to provide a safe alternative for bicyclists and joggers.</p>
<p>The ceremony was followed by a 5K run which took participants along the new pathway towards Summerton and then back again.</p>
