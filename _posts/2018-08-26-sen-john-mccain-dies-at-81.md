<h2>United States Senator and Former Presidential Candidate John McCain Passes away at 81</h2>
Sen. John McCain passed away at his home in Arizona Saturday night, just 24 hours after discontinuing his treatment for Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain tumor which he was diagnosed with last summer.

The former Presidential candidate also served in the US Navy for 23 years and fought in the Vietnam War. When asked what he wanted people to remember about him, Sen. McCain told ABC's The View, "He served his country. And he's proud of his family, and his daughter."

Meghan McCain, co-host of The View on ABC and daughter of the senator released a statement that read "I was with my father at his end, as he was with me at my beginning. In the thirty-three years we shared together, he raised me, taught me, corrected me, comforted me, encouraged me, and supported me in all things."

She went on to add "All that I am is thanks to him. Now that he is gone, the task of my lifetime is to live up to his example, his expectations, and his love. My father's passing comes with sorrow and grief for me, for my mother, for my brothers, and for my sisters."

She also added, "Your prayers, for his soul and for our family, are sincerely appreciated."

President Donald Trump also took to Twitter and said, "My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!"

As well as former President Barack Obama, releasing a statement that read, "Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to put the greater good above our own. At John's best, he showed us what that means. And for that, we are all in his debt. Michelle and I send our most heartfelt condolences to Cindy and their family."

Sen. John McCain served in the US Navy for 23 years, from 1958 to 1981 including serving in the Vietnam War, where he was a prisoner of war for 5 years until his release in 1973. He was elected as the senior United States Senator in 1986 and lost the presidential election in 2008 to Barack Obama.
