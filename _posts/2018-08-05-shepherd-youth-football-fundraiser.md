<p>The Shepherd Youth Football program is currently selling discount cards for $20. Each card entitles the owner to discounts or deals at numerous businesses in the area.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proceeds from the sale go towards the cost of football registration and uniforms. If you are interested, just talk to the parent of a Youth Football athlete.</p>
