The Trunk or Treat will be held in Downtown Shepherd on October 31 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Wright Avenue between 2nd and 3rd street. During the Trunk or Treat, community members will hand out candy out of the trunk of their vehicles. A haunted bus will also be parked on Wright Avenue.

Trick or Treating will also be held at the same time throughout the Village of Shepherd.

If you would like to hand out candy, call 828-5278 to reserve a spot.
