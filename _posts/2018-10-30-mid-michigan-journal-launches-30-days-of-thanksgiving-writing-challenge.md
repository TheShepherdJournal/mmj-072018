<i>The MId Michigan Journal </i>is launching a new writing challenge for November in honor of Thanksgiving called “30 Days of Thankfulness.” Contributors are invited to share notes or stories about the things that they are thankful for.

Submissions can be in the following formats. Submissions can be posted via a form on the site or emailed to <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.
<ul>
 	<li><b>A letter to someone you are thankful for</b> - This would be a letter or short note addressed to a specific person, object, or imaginary character. For example, you could write a letter to your teacher, the sun, or Harry Potter. Notes <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/submit-an-open-letter">can be posted here</a>. Thankful letters should be signed, but if you state that you would like the note to be anonymous and give a reason why I’m willing to make an exception.</li>
 	<li><b>An Essay or story about being thankful</b> - Perhaps there is an event in your life that reminded you the importance of being grateful, or a lesson on thankfulness you’d like to share with readers. <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/post-a-story">Post essays or stories here</a>.</li>
</ul>
Submissions will be collected until Thanksgiving, and will be published throughout the month of November. If you have other ideas for a story you would like to share but you’re not sure, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.
