Over the last three years since the fire that destroyed <em>The Shepherd Argus</em> offices, the Shepherd Area Historical Society has been collecting remaining copies of <em>Argus</em> from area residents, organizing them, and then working with CMU's Clarke Library to digitally preserved them. There are already several issues of <em>The Shepherd </em><em>Argus </em><a href="https://digmichnews.cmich.edu/?a=d&amp;d=IsabellaSA19600608-01&amp;e=-------en-10--1--txt-txIN----------">which can viewed on the Internet</a>.

On October 10, the Shepherd Bar and Restaurant will donate a percentage of its profits from meals served between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to the Shepherd Area Historical Society's Shepherd Argus preservation project. The historical society currently needs to raise $15,000 for the project.
