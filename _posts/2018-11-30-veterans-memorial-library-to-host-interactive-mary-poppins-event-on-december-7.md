On Friday, December 7, the Veterans Memorial Library will host a special interactive presentation of “Mary Poppins.” According to the library’s website, Mary Poppins will “come to life” and “each participant will receive a bag of items they will use throughout the film.” The event will start at 5:30 p.m.

During the film, participants may “whistle, laugh, shake hands, do a little dance, think wink and double blink.”

Pizza provided by Dominoes will be served at the beginning of the event.

The presentation is appropriate for all ages.
