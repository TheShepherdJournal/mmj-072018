<h2>The Gist</h2>
It was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shepherdmihs/photos/a.228594334002326/897350323793387/?type=3">"Picture Day" at Shepherd High School</a>.

I do not have very many fond memories of Picture Day when I was in school. But, then again, that was before they had digital cameras. I wonder how current students feel about having their pictures taken.
