<p>This month, I launched a news website called the <i>Mid Michigan Journal</i>. It is a relaunch of a news resource I had been maintaining during the last few years called <i>The Shepherd Journa</i>l, which was focused around the Shepherd Community.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the chance to provide coverage of Shepherd as well as the greater Mid Michigan area. I am accepting submission of news tips and/or articles via the website (there is a link towards the top labeled "Post a Story") or via the email <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.</p>
<p>I am in need of volunteer community writers, editors, bloggers, and photographers who would be interested in helping with the gathering news and covering major events or news stories.</p>
<p>Anybody who is interested or would like to learn more about the website is welcome to contact me via email or on Facebook. You are also welcome to take a look at the site which can be found at <a href="http://www.midmichiganjournal.com/">http://www.midmichiganjournal.com.</a></p>
